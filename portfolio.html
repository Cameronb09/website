        ROV <br>
        Grove Academy ROV (remotely operated vehicle) project throughout 6th year <br>
        This project involved working in a team of 10 to design, build, and test a fully working robotic ROV capable of being controlled underwater <br>
        This project allowed me to grow many skills, especially teamworking and timekeeping. <br>
        Throughout the project deadlines had to be followed, along with the creation of doccumentation to allow a smooth delivery on time. In the end,
        the project was completed on time and the specifications were met.

    <div class="pr2">Java Class Design <br>
    Creation of classes to implement a program <br>
    This project took place over approximately 1 month during year 1 of the IT Management for Business degree at Dundee University.
    The purpose of this project was to assess knowledge learnt in class and achieve a grade for the module.
    It involved the design of multiple classes in Java, aiming to implement a program to the given specification. <br>
    I had to ensure that the project was completed on time to ensure this assignment was not marked down for lateness.</div>
